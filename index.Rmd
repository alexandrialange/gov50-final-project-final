## Project thoughts

For my final project, I will be using a random generator (ex: spinny wheel with all 50 states) to randomly select 5 states. From this group of states, I will be using the College Board Website to retrieve each state's SAT Suite of Assessments Annual Report for the scores of the class of 2021. The purpose of my study will be to compare trends in mean SAT scores across these states within specific subgroups. These specific subgroups will be gender, highest level of parental education, and median family income.
